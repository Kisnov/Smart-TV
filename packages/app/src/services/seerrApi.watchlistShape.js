/**
 * Watchlist response shape.
 *
 * Kept out of seerrApi.js so it can be unit tested on its own. That module pulls
 * in platform storage as soon as it is imported, which a plain unit test has no
 * way to stand up.
 *
 * /discover/watchlist is the one discover endpoint that doesn't return TMDB
 * shaped results. It uses tmdbId where the others use id, and media where they
 * use mediaInfo. For a user without Plex, Seerr hands back its own watchlist
 * rows, where id is the row's key, so tmdbId always wins. normalizeMediaItem
 * reads item.id for the card and for what opens on select.
